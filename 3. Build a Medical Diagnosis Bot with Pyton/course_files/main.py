# To test list_patients, add some patients and diagnoses to  patients_and_diagnoses and run the function, ensuring that the printed list matches and changes made

# To test assess_appearance(), start_new_diagnosis(), and main(), run the functions individually and ensure that what you're seeing printed to the console matches what is expected. Also make sure to cover all possible cases. Try all 4 possible diagnoses. Try running the diagnoses with some invalid inputs.
